## hey!

these are *not* release versions of dogescript. these are development versions of dogescript 2.4.0, and are not updated on every commit (they're just here right now to make sure the commands work). once 2.4.0 is released, these will be the latest stable release.

```bash
# in the parent directory:
npm install
# and then:
npm run build # builds the file
npm run min # compresses it
npm run dist # does both
```
