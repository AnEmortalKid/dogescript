### Developer versions

If you wish to take your dogescript to the moon and live at the edge of amaze, you can install the dogescript version as it exists in this repository:

1. `npm install` the repository
1. link the newer version with `npm link`
1. Verify by running `dogescript`, something like the following should show up (version # might be different but the pre syntax will still be there):
```bash
$ dogescript
[dogescript@2.4.0-pre]
DOGE>
```
1. To restore, navigate out of the dogescript repository and reinstall an earlier version:
`npm install dogescript@2.3.0 -g`
